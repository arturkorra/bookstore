 Click [BookStore](https://bookstoredemotask.herokuapp.com/bookstore/swagger-ui.html#/) for online demo. 
 
 The "BOOKSTORE" is a spring boot web application used to demonstrate how an online store API works.
 
 To build this application I have been using SPRING-BOOT, MYSQL, MAVEN, JDK11 and ECLIPSE IDE.
 
 The application expose 5 end points using REST web services with JSON.
 
 This application does not include spring security so end points are public.
 
 Swagger is configured!
 
 There are 2 entity classes Book and Customer to save the data in DB.
 
 The application can handle some custom exceptions.
 
 When the application starts if DB is empty some data will be loaded.
 
 I hope I have covered everything required for this task in the right way.
 
 
# RUN THE APP
 The application is configured to connect with an online MYSQL DB,
 
 and to run the application simple run it as Spring Boot application or Java application as well since Tomact Server  is embedded.
 
 Also you can check the URL provided where this application is running at "Heroku".
